    - Components

1 - Components

    - Reusable building blocks of UI
    - React functions that return JSX.
    - Two types of components
        - class components
            - use class syntax to create components that come with various built in methods for different purposes.
            - import { Component } from "react";
            - class ComponentName extends Component {
                render {
                    return <some jsx>;
                }
            }
            - has built in constructor() that lets us add state to the component.
        - functional components
