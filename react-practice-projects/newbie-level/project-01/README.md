## Overview

This is my first practice project from Frontend Mentor in this "newbie" series where I use ReactJS and TailwindCSS to make all projects.

## My process

### Tools used

Following are the tools/languages that were used to build this project.

- React
- React DOM
- Create-react-app
- TailwindCSS
- JavaScript
- Node to install all the dependencies

### Challenges faced

I faced one major challenge while creating this project.

- I used TailwindCSS for the first time and hence was finding hard to implement the classes declared in Tailwind. Though the understood core concepts of Tailwind, still to apply those classes, I had to constantly search and keep applying.

### Lessons learned

This project was a good starter for me to put my React and Tailwind knowledge to practice. I learned a lot about how Tailwind works and why it is preferred in the developer community.

The idea of styling components without writing any custom css and leaving the HTML/JSX is really powerful.
