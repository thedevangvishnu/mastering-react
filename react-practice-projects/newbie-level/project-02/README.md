## Overview

This is my second practice project from Frontend Mentor in this "newbie" series where I use ReactJS and TailwindCSS to make all projects.

## My process

### Tools used

Following are the tools/languages that were used to build this project.

- React
- React DOM
- Create-react-app
- TailwindCSS
- JavaScript
- Node to install all the dependencies

### Challenges faced

Didn't face any major challenges during this project as it was my second one that I made using React and TailwindCSS and this order summary component didn't involve much logic. It just needed to be designed.

### Lessons learned

This project was a good starter for me to put my React and Tailwind knowledge to practice. I learned some more TailwindCSS classes related to position, hover and transition.
